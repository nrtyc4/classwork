A select is like a switch statement in which the cases are communications.
A simple example uses a second channel to tear down the server.

func server(op binOp, service chan *request,
		quit chan bool)	{
	for {
		select {
		case req := <-service:
			go run(op, req);	//don't wait
		case <-quit:
			return;
		}
	}
}
