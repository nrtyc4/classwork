var c chan string;

c = make(chan string);

c <- "Hello";	// infix send

// in a different goroutine
greeting := <-c;	// prefix recieve

cc := new(chan chan string);

cc <- c;	// handing off a capability



***Buffered channels***

It's also possible to pass a second parameter to the make function when creating a channel:

	c := make(chan int, 1)

This creates a buffered channel with capacity of 1. Normally channels are synchronous; both sides of the channel will wait until the other side is ready. A buffered channel is asynchrounous; sending or receiving a message will not wait unless the channel is already full.
