The GeoQuiz app will consist of an Activity and a Layout.

-	An activity is and instance of Activity, a class in the Android SDK. An activity is responsible for managing user interaction with a screen of information.
	You write subclasses of Activity to implement the functionality that your app requires A simple app may need only one subclass: a complex app can have many.

	GeoQuiz is a simple app, so it will have a single Activity subclass named QuizActivity.

-	A layout defines a set of user interface objects and their position on the screen. A layout is made up of definitions written in XML. Each definition is used to create an object that appears on the screen, like a button or some text.

	GeoQuiz will include a layout file named activity_quiz.xml.
